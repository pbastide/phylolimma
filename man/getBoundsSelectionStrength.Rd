\value{
A vector with lower and upper bounds for alpha
}
\description{
Find reasonable bounds on the \code{alpha} parameter.
}
\details{
This functions tries to find reasonable bounds on the \eqn{\alpha} parameter
of an OU process by using the scaled phylogenetic half-life \eqn{t_{1/2} = \log(2) / \alpha / h},
where \eqn{h} is the total height of the tree.
If \eqn{t_{1/2} = D)}, it means that the trait will need a time \eqn{D \times h}
to cover half the distance to the optimal value (see Hansen, 1997).
Small values of \eqn{D} means high selection pressure (large \eqn{\alpha}),
while large values of \eqn{D} means low selection pressure (small \eqn{\alpha}).

The default maximum value for \eqn{D} is \code{relative_half_life_max = 10000}
(selection is week and the process looks like a BM).

The default minimum value for \eqn{D} is \code{relative_half_life_min = 0.0001}
(selection is strong and tips are only weakly correlated).

The function makes sure that the maximum \eqn{\alpha} value associated with
\code{relative_half_life_min} does not lead to underflow errors when rescaling
the tree.
