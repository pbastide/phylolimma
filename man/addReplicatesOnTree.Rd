\usage{
addReplicatesOnTree(
  tree,
  traits,
  species = "species",
  id = "id",
  eps = .Machine$double.eps^2
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylogenetic tree with n tips.}

\item{traits}{A data frame containing at least two columns,
one with sample ids, and on with species names for each samples.}

\item{species}{Name of the column containing species names. Default to "species".}

\item{id}{Name of the column containing samples ids. Default to "id".}

\item{eps}{A small number to add to terminal branch lengths to avoid true zeros. Default to \code{.Machine$double.eps}.}
}
\value{
A phylogenetic tree with as many tips as the number of rows in \code{traits},
 and clusters of tips with zero branch lengths corresponding to replicates.
}
\description{
Utility function to add replicates to a tree, as tips with zero length branches.
